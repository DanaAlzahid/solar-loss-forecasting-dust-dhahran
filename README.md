Machine learning‚Äìbased forecasting of next-day solar energy losses in Dhahran, analyzing the impact of dust storms and meteorological conditions.

# üå™Ô∏è Dust Storms & Solar Loss Analysis & Forecasting in Dhahran  
*Machine Learning & Data Analysis for Renewable Energy Reliability*  

This project investigates the impact of **dust storms** and **atmospheric conditions** on solar energy availability in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  
It begins with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** comparing clear-sky vs all-sky radiation, anomalies, and dust storm impacts,  
and then extends into **machine learning forecasting** to predict **next-day solar energy loss** using NASA POWER data and meteorological indicators.  

By combining **analysis + forecasting**, the project highlights the challenges of modeling rare severe solar-loss events  
and provides insights for improving renewable energy planning in dust-prone regions.
