Machine learning–based forecasting of next-day solar energy losses in Dhahran, analyzing the impact of dust storms and meteorological conditions.

# 🌪️ Dust Storms & Solar Loss Forecasting in Dhahran  
**Machine Learning & Data Analysis for Renewable Energy Reliability**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates the impact of **dust storms** and **atmospheric conditions** on solar energy availability in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Using **NASA POWER data** and machine learning models (Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest, etc.), it forecasts **next-day solar loss percentages** and analyzes the role of meteorological and aerosol indicators.  

The study highlights challenges in forecasting **rare severe solar-loss events** and provides insights into improving model reliability.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Clear-sky vs all-sky radiation, trends, and anomalies.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Forecasting:** Gradient Boosting, feature engineering with rolling means and lags.  
- 📉 **Forecast Verification:** Actual vs predicted, residuals, and precision-recall analysis.  
- 🌍 **Feature Importance:** Identifies persistence, humidity, and wind as main drivers.  
- ⚡ **Challenge Highlight:** Class imbalance prevents accurate severe event detection.
